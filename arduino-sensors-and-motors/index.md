# Arduino Sensors and Motors

This is a research article that presents a collection of documentation and code
examples as a theoretical framework for different infrared sensors, for
Bluetooth connection and for direct current motors applied to the Arduino board.

## Introduction

When learning the Arduino platform in overall there are many possibilities to
explore and some of them are sensors, external modules that attach to the
Arduino board like a Bluetooth module for wireless connectivity, and actuators
like direct current motors including stepper motors. These are some basic 
devices to start getting utility out of Arduino board applications.

Here you can identify the needs to use inputs, outputs, power control by PWM,
response times, wireless control of devices, coupling of external devices and
others that are widely applied to daily life in mobile or security devices or
even industrial applications for heavier power control but with similar designs.
