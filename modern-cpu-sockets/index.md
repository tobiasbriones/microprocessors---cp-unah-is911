# Modern CPU Sockets

This research framework provides a summary of existing modern PC sockets in
2022.

## Introduction

Sockets are connectors that allow physical and electrical connectivity from the
microprocessor to the motherboard. They are also known as "slots".

As mentioned above, we can make the following statement about sockets:

> A **CPU socket** or **CPU slot** contains one or more mechanical
> components providing mechanical and electrical connections between a
> microprocessor and a printed circuit board (PCB). This allows for placing and
> replacing the central processing unit (CPU) without soldering.

To list some types of sockets, we have [1]: TR4, AM4, LGA 1151, 2066, sTRX4.
When designing a configuration for a PC, it must be taken into account that the
motherboard is compatible with the rest of the chosen hardware and, in
particular, that the socket is the one that corresponds to the model of the CPU
that must be installed.

### Definition

A simple definition of a socket is:

> The socket refers to a physical connector on a computer motherboard that
> accepts a single physical chip. Many motherboards can have multiple sockets 
> that can in turn accept multi-core chips.

Personal computers (including gaming PCs) and industrial computers have similar
or the same sockets. These sockets are mostly found on these computers, unlike
mobile devices like laptops or smartphones, which bring the CPU soldered on the
motherboard or have a SoC (System on a Chip), an integrated circuit that
implements the CPU, memory, and others' components on a single chip.

## Socket Types

According to current data, the types of sockets that are currently used for
personal computers, gaming and even workstation or industrial / servers will be
shown next.

There is a large number of old sockets [^1], only the most recent will be detailed.

[^1]: Wikipedia [11] lists a great amount of old models from 1,970 which can be
    recognized by the reader (if old enough) like the LGA775 used by our old 
    Intel Pentium 4/D or Core2Duo

For desktop PC there are the following models:

| Socket Name               | Introduction Year | CPUs                                                      | Package | Pins |

Computers can be classified into conventional (PC or personal computer), HEDT 
(High-End Desktop are High-Performance PCs), or Servers/Industrial/WorkStations.
The sockets listed here are for conventional desktop PCs with very popular CPUs,
and some of them are high-performance CPUs like the AMD Ryzen Threadripper, and
Intel Core X (LGA 2066/Socket R4). These are examples of desktop and server
models as well.

Among the mentioned models above and other popular ones, a resume with the
following more-practical information is displayed next, including the CPU model(
s), generation, compatible chipsets, and type of personal computer:

- **Intel LGA 2066:** 10ma Gen., X299, HEDT.
- **Intel LGA 1200:** 11/10ma Gen., Z490/H470, B460, H410, Convencional.
- **Intel LGA 1151:** 9/8va Gen., Z390/Z370/Z370/Q370/H370/B365/B360/H310,
  Convencional.
- **AMD sTRX4:** Ryzen Threadripper 3000, TRX40, HEDT.
- **AMD TR4:** Ryzen Threadripper 2000 y 1000, x399, HEDT.

## Functioning

The mechanism of functioning is defined according to the socket package. As
mentioned, the operation of a socket is such that it allows the physical
connection of the microprocessor to the motherboard.

### Land Grid Array (LGA)

LGA sockets are the most populars since much today's PC CPU models employ 
this kind of socket.

According to *ONLOGIC Blog* [3], most modern removable CPUs use LGA sockets.

Their functioning consists of:

> The land grid array (LGA) is a type of surface-mount packaging for integrated
> circuits (ICs) that is notable for having the pins on the socket 
> (when a socket is used) rather than the integrated circuit.
> 
> LGA can be electrically connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) either by 
> the use of a socket or by soldering directly to the board.
> 
> The land grid array is a packaging technology with a rectangular grid of 
> contacts, 'lands', on the underside of a package. The contacts are to be 
> connected to a grid of contacts on the PCB. Not all rows and columns of the 
> grid need to be used.
> 
> Unlike the pin grid array (PGA) interface found on most AMD and older Intel 
> processors, there are no pins on the chip; in place of the pins are pads of 
> bare gold-plated copper that touch protruding pins on the microprocessor's 
> connector on the motherboard.

</figcaption>

As can be seen, both major manufacturers, AMD and Intel use it for many of their
microprocessors. Note that, for example, Socket sTRX4 is actually an LGA 
4094 [10].

### Pin Grid Array (PGA)

Its functioning is as follows:

> A pin grid array (PGA) is a type of integrated circuit packaging. In a PGA,
> the package is square or rectangular, and the pins are arranged in a regular 
> array on the underside of the package.
> 
> PGAs are often mounted on printed circuit boards using the through hole method
> or inserted into a socket.
>

### Ball Grid Array (BGA)

Mostly used for mobile devices or for electrical engineering
[9] thus we don't care too much about it in this article. We have that:

> A ball grid array (BGA) is a type of surface-mount packaging (a chip carrier) 
> used for integrated circuits. BGA packages are used to permanently mount 
> devices such as microprocessors.
> 
> The BGA is descended from the pin grid array (PGA), which is a package with 
> one face covered (or partly covered) with pins in a grid pattern which, in 
> operation, conduct electrical signals between the integrated circuit and the 
> printed circuit board (PCB) on which it is placed. In a BGA the pins are 
> replaced by pads on the bottom of the package, each initially with a tiny 
> solder ball stuck to it.
>

### Zero Insertion Force (ZIF)

The ZIF socket allows to insert the IC pretty easy. For example, we have the 
PIC microcontroller's programmer where we insert the IC directly into the 
socket.

![ZIF Socket](images/zif-socket.jpg)

</figcaption>

Its functioning consists of:

> Zero insertion force (ZIF) is a type of IC socket or electrical connector that
> requires very little force for insertion. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is 
> inserted, a lever or slider on the side of the socket is moved, pushing all 
> the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little 
> force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external 
> downward force is required.
>

Therefore, they are niche sockets, and we don't care about them eiter. 

## Conclusion

The main information on the sockets currently used (year 2022) for conventional
microprocessors or PCs was listed. It was briefly explained how the CPU sockets
work, and that there are categories of PCs depending on the needs of users,
requiring different types of sockets. It was noticed that the LGA socket package
is the most widely used for PCs.
